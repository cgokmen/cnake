This is a Snake implementation for the GBA by Cem Gokmen for Georgia Tech CS2110 in Spring 2017.

It uses Mode 3 for drawing static screens and mode 4 for drawing the game screen.

For information about the controls, run the game and look at the information on the start screen.

It's a Snake game, you'll get it.
